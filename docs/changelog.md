## Version 1.5.1.2

* Changed the license in the Github repo back to MIT

---

## Version = 1.5.1.1

* Rerelease due to not shipping the DLL

---

## Version = 1.5.1.0

* Recompiled against KSP 1.6.1
* Fixed SRBs rolling 4-5 times before launch (which was leading to the abnormally high failure rates)
* Fixed all parts automatically being tested because apparently vessel.speed is not relative to the vessel.....
* Fixed SRB safety ratings not really reflecting the parts likelyhood to fail.
* Fixed invalid characters in EngineFailureModule patch
* Fixed Space Engine (Terrier etc) always having a Safety Rating of 1 and simultaneously being physically capable of failing.
* Logger will create Logs directory if it doesn't exist
* Slightly reduced baseFailureChance of SRBs

---

## Version = 1.5.0.0

* Fixed issue where failure rolls would be spammed in prelaunch
* Exposed baseFailureChance and expectedLifetime for Space Engines in the MM config for EngineFailureModule
* Added bash script to automate release build process (only relevant if you are compiling from source, but it's in the Github Repo so mentioned it here)

---

## Version = 1.4.2.0

* Fixed SRBs being allowed to fail during KRASH simulations (for real this time)

---

## Version = 1.4.1.0

* Fixed SRBs being allowed to fail during KRASH simulations

---

## Version = 1.4.0.0

* CKAN USERS ONLY: Kerbal Changelog by Benjamin Kerman is now a required dependency
* MANUALLY INSTALLED USERS: Kerbal Changelog by Benjamin Kerman is bundled as an optional (but recommended) mod.
* Recompile against KSP 1.5.1
* Failures will no longer be calculated per part. Instead, we'll take into account the overall reliability of the vessel, and use that to determine failure rates. (Ie, if you stick a bunch of really good parts on your rocket, and one really crappy one, the rocket will still be less prone to fail than one with all crappy parts). A really cool side effect of this, is that if you stage away your bad parts, your vessel will become more reliable overall (ie, you can have a bad launch vehicle, but a tried and tested payload, and once the launch vehicle is gone, the payload will be uber reliable).
* Failures will be rolled for constantly (but rate limited) instead of just on loading the vessel. At the moment, it's every 10 seconds in atmosphere for the first two minutes, every 2.5 minutes after that while in atmosphere (known as "plane mode") and every 30 kerbal minutes out of the atmosphere - to simulate the fact that things are much more likely to go wrong on launch.
* All of the above parameters can be edited in DefaultSettings.cfg which is located at OhScrap/PluginData
* Parts can only fail if they are actually in use (ie engines firing, Reaction wheels turning, etc) - this may have been technically in the last version, but I found a bunch of places where it wasn't actually turned on.
* Overall rebalance of the reliability system
* Remote Repair has been reduced to a 20% chance of success, EVA to 40% and engineers will give a 10%*their level boost to the repair chance (so a Lv5 Engineer will give you a 90% chance of repair on EVA).
* MASSIVE code cleanup - handling the failures on a per vessel, rather than per part basis means less garbage, better performance and easier for me to maintain etc. I've also moved a BUNCH of duplicated code into their own common methods.
  * Parts that have not been tested/launched can now be recovered. The tradeoff for this is that those parts will receive NO bonuses for recovery. Ie, it will still have the failure rate of a "fresh off the factory line" part.
  * Parts that have not been tested/launched can now be recovered. The tradeoff for this is that those parts will receive NO bonuses for recovery. Ie, it will still have the failure rate of a "fresh off the factory line" part.
  * Randomisation is gone. Parts will have standard failure rates.
  * Safety Rating system now runs from 1-10 rather than 1-5
* Safety Ratings are now relative rather than absolute (ie it's linked to the parts base reliability, not a fixed number)
* Mod will log to the OhScrap/Logs folder
* "Extra Logging" option will show you every roll and a guess at the probability of a part failing in the next 2 minutes/15 minutes/30 days (depending on the Vessels Situation). Note that this can be inaccurate in some situations.
* You can also see this information in the UI by creating an empty text file called debug.txt in the Oh Scrap Directory (all lower case if your OS cares about such things)
  * Probably a bunch of other stuff I'm not remembering right now.
* Added option to override Stage Recovery and recover parts but no funds. Please note this is highly experimental and may not even work at all.
